//! External agent adapters: every way Viden drives an agent that runs in
//! another process.
//!
//! # Boundary
//!
//! This crate sits below `viden-runtime` and knows nothing about sessions,
//! lanes, providers, frontends, or the runtime's trust loop. It owns one
//! strategy per external CLI — the generic ACP JSON-RPC client, the Codex
//! app-server and CLI client, and the spawn/probe infrastructure both share —
//! and it reaches the operating system only through `viden-tools`
//! capabilities (filesystem, process, terminal). It never opens a process, a
//! file, or a socket itself.
//!
//! Runtime policy arrives as parameters rather than imports, which is what
//! keeps the dependency edge one-directional:
//!
//! - a `PermissionContext` and a `PermissionEngine` describe what the agent's
//!   reverse-RPC filesystem and terminal requests are allowed to do;
//! - an approver closure carries an `Ask` out to whichever operator surface
//!   the embedding runtime owns;
//! - a [`RuntimeEventSink`] receives the runtime events an agent turn
//!   produces, so this crate never decides where a fact is persisted.
//!
//! Permission checks still happen before effects: every reverse-RPC mutation
//! resolves through `viden_permissions::resolve_permission`, the shared
//! decide -> ask -> apply_approval gate, before the capability is called.
//!
//! Module ownership, in dependency order:
//!
//! - [`infra`]: process spawning, shell command planning, output capture, and
//!   the static adapter descriptor table. Knows nothing about a protocol.
//! - [`acp`]: the ACP wire protocol — framing, handshake, prompt turns, update
//!   and patch parsing, and the reverse-RPC filesystem/terminal callbacks the
//!   agent makes back into us.
//! - [`codex`]: the Codex band — CLI command handlers, job records and their
//!   lifecycle, diagnostics, and the app-server JSON-RPC client.
//! - [`glue`]: protocol-independent session glue — the resident ACP session
//!   cache, the typed-session entrypoints, job/task/adapter-view projections,
//!   and runtime-event persistence.
//! - [`render`]: presentation helpers for the `/agent` command surface.
//!
//! The `SessionEngine` command surface that dispatches to these bands stays in
//! `viden-runtime` (`agent_dispatch.rs`); it calls into the bands rather than
//! reaching into their internals.
